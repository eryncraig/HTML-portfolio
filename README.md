# Project: HTML Portfolio

This project was created to showcase my knowledge of basic HTML by building a portfolio website using only HTML and CSS, plus tota11y, the Javascript minfier. I also used a CSS autoprefixer. These tools outside of the core code are mainly there as examples, since the site itself is small and lightweight.

## My Role
This was one of my most recent HTML projects, written only by myself. I based the styles of of a user story prompt, making adjustments with images and icons created with reCraft, an AI image engine. The forms in this case are not functional, nor does the 'work' section have projects, as this site is primarily for showcasing the HTML, not as an official portfolio site. That said, you are more than welcome to base a site off this code as it is easy to inject those elements. Edits to the original project are not allowed, however. Please fork or make a copy if you use this code.

### Dependencies:
None

### Host:
gh-pages

### To run locally:
You can open any of the .html files in your choice of browser and it should work. Chrome and Firefox are best of course!
